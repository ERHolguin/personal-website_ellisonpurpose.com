Objective 
- Build a personal website to showcase my projects. 
- This website will also be used as a sandbox to practice my skills.


                        Learning Opportunities

- Programming Languages:
    -HTML5
    -CSS3
    -JavaScript 

Design:
- Translate a design file and feature ideas into code without embedding templates into the project. Doing so helped me improve my non-existent design skills. 
- Learne how to use proper color coordination for accessibility and visibility.
- Update an existing design to my liking 
- Graphic Design: design a logo that aligned with my personal brand. 

Rapid Development 
- Built to ship: 
- Focus on the minimum features to launch quickly.
- Choose features before building to avoid “scope creep”.

Clean Code 
- Test custom file structure (combination of folder and file) to organize the code.
